# Real-Time Sentiment Analysis of Amazon Product Reviews

This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze and visualize customer sentiment in Amazon product reviews. The system integrates both rule-based and transformer-based sentiment models to provide real-time analysis and insights that can help businesses understand customer perception and predict future purchasing behavior.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

The goal is to develop a tool that:
- Analyzes sentiment of Amazon product reviews using VADER and RoBERTa models.
- Correlates sentiment polarity with actual star ratings.
- Provides real-time predictions for incoming customer feedback.
- Helps Amazon sellers or product teams assess customer satisfaction and proactively improve services.
